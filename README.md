Certificate Management has been built via Python3-Django(1.11 LTS) and AngularJS (Angular1)

Database: SQLite

Install instruction:

	python3 -m venv env

	source env/bin/acticate

	cd certificates

	pip install --upgrade pip

	pip install -r requirements.txt

	python manage.py runserver

We suggest you should upgrade AngularJs to Angular2 or to highest Angular4 for long term support.
